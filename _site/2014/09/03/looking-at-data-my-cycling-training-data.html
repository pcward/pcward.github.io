<p>Looks like I&#8217;ve been slacking on the bike so far this week, compared to last week! This week&#8217;s data is the darker colored stuff, last week&#8217;s data is the lighter colored stuff.</p>
<p>I pulled the data from my <a href="http://cyclinganalytics.com" target="_blank">Cycling Analytics</a> account using their <a href="http://www.cyclinganalytics.com/developer/api" target="_blank">API</a>. I then massaged it with a Python script I wrote to augment some of the charting I felt was missing in the Cycling Analytics dashboard (I know this stuff is available out of the box from TrainingPeaks, but 1) it was fun to program the API myself, and 2) I refuse to pay for TrainingPeaks).</p>

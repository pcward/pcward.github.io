				<h3><a href="/2012/09/15/1-no-matter-how-much-data-you-collect-you-never.html">1. No matter how much data you collect, you never have all the data you want or need</a></h3>
				<h5 class="post_date">2012-09-15 08:21:00 -0600</h5>
				<p>People often get caught up in the <em>more-is-better</em> mentality when it comes to data. Of course, larger quantities are usually better, and time-series and panel data is superior to cross-sectional data. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about here. </p>
<p>When I refer to data wants versus data needs I refer to the actual variables you&#8217;re collecting.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve established a set of business objectives, and you&#8217;ve gone to the trouble of quantifying those objectives in a set of goals the next step is to spend some time figuring out the variables you need in order to assess how you&#8217;re doing against your goals. I basically see two approaches at this junction:</p>
<ol><li>throw the kitchen sink at it</li>
<li>deliberately choose your approach</li>
</ol><p>Throwing the kitchen sink at the problem usually masks one of two things:</p>
<ol><li>a lack of understanding of the problem at hand, or</li>
<li>intellectual laziness</li>
</ol><p>It&#8217;s easy to become greedy and want to collect everything under the sun. This also reflects laziness.</p>
<p>The better approach is to be deliberate. Taking the time to think through your business objectives and goals, and how the metrics you choose relate to those objectives and goals, will help you provide real, useful insights. It will prevent garbage in—garbage out.</p>
<p>Of course, to be able to do this, you need to have a real understanding of the problem at hand.</p>
<p>After establishing a good understanding of the problem domain, we need to select the appropriate metrics. Keeping in mind that less is (usually) more, it&#8217;s worth spending some time figuring out which metrics truly matter.</p>
<p>Is it possible that some of the things we <em>want </em>can be derived from simpler variables? Being surgical about the things we collect doesn&#8217;t preclude us from running expansive and nuanced analysis. It also helps us remain friends with the guys actually implementing the process, and it reduces costs. </p>
<p>Fundamentally, it comes down to letting ourselves be guided by <em>Occam&#8217;s Razor</em>, despite the temptations to go hog wild in the candy store that can be Big Data.</p>

				<h3><a href="/2012/09/12/how-are-saas-companies-revamping-their-marketing.html">How are SaaS companies revamping their marketing to keep pace with changing buyer behavior? </a></h3>
				<h5 class="post_date">2012-09-12 11:35:00 -0600</h5>
				<p>This is the question posed over in the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=62352" target="_blank">Digital Marketing group on LinkedIn (you should check it out)</a> right now. People have pointed out the need for involving more than just sales and marketing in recruiting new customers, which I think is an excellent point. 37Signals is a great example of this, where the founders are actively involved with their user community.</p>
<p>There has also been quite a good discussion about the sales funnel needing to become more a &#8220;funnel of interest,&#8221; with a push towards multiple opportunities to boost interest levels. This ties in with some thinking I&#8217;ve been doing around SaaS companies and trials as a sales/marketing tool. Not enough SaaS companies use trials as well as they could. Lots of times, user trials are completely unguided, which works really well for advanced/expert users. But you run the risk of losing a lot of potentially solid leads because they, perhaps, become overwhelmed by &#8220;Microsoft Office syndrome,&#8221; the trial can be seen as too complex.</p>
<p>Finally, a recommended read: <a href="http://goo.gl/2v1pE" target="_blank">7 Marketing 3.0 Lessons from Inbound 2012</a>.</p>

				<h2>Or: Chris Ward’s most relevant set of ‘ism’s’ for succeeding as a data analyst</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m launching a new series on the things I learned in my four years as a PhD student/research analyst at the U of U. Once or twice a week I&#8217;ll be posting another &#8216;ism&#8217; I picked up while crunching numbers for research projects on online behavior and crowdfunding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly doing this as an exercise in self-awareness as I transition out of academia and into a Web/data analyst role at a data-driven tech company&#8212;know anyone hiring data guys? There&#8217;s a lot to be gained from some healthy introspection, and who knows? Maybe there&#8217;s a helpful gem in there somewhere for someone else.</p>
<p>So long!</p>

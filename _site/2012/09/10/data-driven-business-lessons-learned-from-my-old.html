<h2>Or: Chris Ward’s most relevant set of ‘ism’s’ for succeeding as a data analyst</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m launching a new series on the things I learned in my four years as a PhD student/research analyst at the U of U. Once or twice a week I&#8217;ll be posting another &#8216;ism&#8217; I picked up while crunching numbers for research projects on online behavior and crowdfunding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m mostly doing this as an exercise in self-awareness as I transition out of academia and into a Web/data analyst role at a data-driven tech company&#8212;know anyone hiring data guys? There&#8217;s a lot to be gained from some healthy introspection, and who knows? Maybe there&#8217;s a helpful gem in there somewhere for someone else.</p>
<p>So long!</p>

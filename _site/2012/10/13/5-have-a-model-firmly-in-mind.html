<p>Have a model firmly in mind. <em>No model—no insights!!</em> Not having a clear understanding of the real purpose of the campaign, trend, or other business problem you&#8217;re looking at is the main reason for muddy analysis and failure in data-driven campaigns. </p>
<p>&#8220;<em>But Chris, what&#8217;s a data analyst to do?</em>" Glad you asked! Here&#8217;s a good framework to get you started:</p>
<p><strong>A.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Business objectives.</strong> Define the business objectives relevant to your question; Do they meet the DUMB (doable, understandable, manageable, beneficial) test?</p>
<p><strong>B.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Clear goals.</strong> Set some clear and <em>measurable</em> goals for each identified business objective. Making sure your goals are quantifiable guarantees that they&#8217;re <em>specific</em> enough. Specificity drives clarity!</p>
<p><strong>C.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>KPIs.</strong> How will you measure your goals? See above.</p>
<p><strong>D.<span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Segments.</strong> If you want to take your analysis from good to great, take the time to define some segments, of people/behavior/outcomes; This will help you frame your understanding of the data.</p>
<p>Segmenting, and running analysis on a segment-by-segment basis, will yield such a richer picture of what&#8217;s going on. This is something an aggregate analysis has difficulty picking up.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you sell high-end sporting equipment online and you run marketing based on a young up and coming superstar in the sport. If you segment by age you bet conversion rates will be vastly different between young folks and baby boomers.</p>
<p><em>Not segmenting might mask the true success (or failure!) of your campaigns.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for now, and should get you started on taking your analysis from woolen to great—and <em>you</em> from just a number cruncher to department superstar.</p>

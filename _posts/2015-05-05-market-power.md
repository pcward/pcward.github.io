[This piece in Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/05/05/distribution-trust-market-power) makes so much sense. It also explains why Blackboard's market power is eroding. They have the distribution part down, but the trust part has sadly been abused for years, to the point where its rather non-existant.

Right now, Instructure has the trust part pretty down, and as long as they can build on the already existing pretty awesome distribution growth, things are looking bright. The challenge, of course, is to not lose sight of either element once you've grown nice and big. And of course, I'm a little biased.

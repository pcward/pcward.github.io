<p>Adobe just released their global digital advertising update for Q2&#160;2012, and things are looking good in search marketing!</p>
<p>Insights gleaned from analyzing data from over 5,000 companies worldwide that use the Adobe Digital Marketing Suite show paid search continued the growth trend from Q1 across industries, and both spend and ROI improved. This was driven by lower CPC.Â </p>
<p>Especially interesting is that tablet and mobile show very competitive ROI, and should be a major focus going forward. The figures below show this really well.</p>

<p>Facebook is still an uncertain channel, but brands are getting a better hang on using social to drive fan growth and engagement. Adobe suggests these positive changes for Facebook-driven marketing were driven by changes made to the Facebook platform in the last two quarters (e.g. Timeline) and new and better engagement and acquisition metrics.</p>

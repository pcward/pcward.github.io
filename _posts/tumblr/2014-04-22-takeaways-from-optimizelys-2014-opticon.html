<p>Last week I had the honor of flying out to San Francisco for Optimizely&#8217;s first Opticon conference to represent CLEARLINK.</p>

<p>I wanted to soak up all the knowledge and wisdom from the source itself. As a direct response marketing company, we&#8217;re continually trying to understand our customers and what makes them tick, so testing and optimization, continuing to deliver an improved and more compelling marketing message on behalf of our brand partners.</p>

<p>I was floored by the quality of the event, the speakers, and the panels Optimizely had put together!</p>
<p>Additionally, Rachel Johnson and I were honored to be the recipients of the inaugural Optie Award in the category for &#8220;Best Advanced Feature Use&#8221;!</p>

<p>Below are the three biggest takeaways from my experience.</p>

<h3>1. JUST TEST IT!</h3>
<p>Use A/B testing for &#8220;argument prevention&#8221;<br/><em>Dave Nuffer (Liftopia) and Alissa Polucha (Microsoft)</em></p>
<p>Testing helps us remove &#8220;I think&#8221; and &#8220;I like,&#8221; and move towards &#8220;I know&#8221;</p>
<h3>2. Focus on the problem, not the solution</h3>
<p><em> Hiten Shah (KISSMetrics)</em></p>
<ol><li>Find out why people don&#8217;t convert</li>
<li>Use the exact words customers do
<ul><li>What do or do you not like?</li>
<li>What is the primary benefit you received from X?</li>
<li>How would you describe our product to a friend?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be very specific with calls-to-action</li>
<li>Start with a hypothesis, then prioritize</li>
<li>Create experiments that are small</li>
<li>Continuously experiment</li>
</ol><h3>3. Experimentation never ends: iterate!</h3>
<p>Take the learnings from your last experiment and always try to improve on them. For example, Alissa Polucha from Microsoft Store shared the example of how the MS Office page on microsoft.com has gone through six iterations of testing so far, just to get where they are today</p>

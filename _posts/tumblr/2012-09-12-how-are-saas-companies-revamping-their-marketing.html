<p>This is the question posed over in the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=62352" target="_blank">Digital Marketing group on LinkedIn (you should check it out)</a> right now. People have pointed out the need for involving more than just sales and marketing in recruiting new customers, which I think is an excellent point. 37Signals is a great example of this, where the founders are actively involved with their user community.</p>
<p>There has also been quite a good discussion about the sales funnel needing to become more a &#8220;funnel of interest,&#8221; with a push towards multiple opportunities to boost interest levels. This ties in with some thinking I&#8217;ve been doing around SaaS companies and trials as a sales/marketing tool. Not enough SaaS companies use trials as well as they could. Lots of times, user trials are completely unguided, which works really well for advanced/expert users. But you run the risk of losing a lot of potentially solid leads because they, perhaps, become overwhelmed by &#8220;Microsoft Office syndrome,&#8221; the trial can be seen as too complex.</p>

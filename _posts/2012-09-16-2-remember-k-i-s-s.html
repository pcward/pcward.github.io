<p><em>When attacking a data-driven business question, keep it simple, stupid!</em></p>
<p>At least do this until you have a good understanding of the problem, and your most important stakeholders are on board and do too.</p>
<p>Doing this accomplishes a few critical things:</p>
<p>One, you save yourself a lot of unnecessary work if your analysis isn&#8217;t what your stakeholders want.</p>
<p>Two, keeping your analysis straightforward builds trust in your recommendations and findings. People won&#8217;t get the impression you&#8217;re trying to pull wool over their eyes.</p>
<p>And three, there&#8217;s usually just not a really good reason for  sophisticated statistics in most real-world analytics. At least not where the field stands today. Besides, why start an (unnecessary) arms race when you don&#8217;t have to? </p>
<p><em>Clarity trumps sophistication, every time.</em></p>

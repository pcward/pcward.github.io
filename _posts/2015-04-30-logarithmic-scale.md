title: Logarithmic scales are hard
---

Logarithmic scales are hard (yes, I know what you're thinking...). For most people, the idea that 4 is twice as big as 2 is intuitive, because we're conditioned to think on a linear scale. With the recent [horrible earthquake in Nepal](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&authuser=0&q=nepal+earthquake+2015&oq=nepal+earthquake+2015&gs_l=news-cc.3..43j43i53.972.5009.0.5089.21.10.0.11.11.2.146.1007.4j6.10.0...0.0...1ac.1.TyGNfpjGBp0), log scales are again in the news.

Quartz did a [phenomenal vizualization](http://qz.com/394053/was-the-nepal-earthquake-twice-as-big-as-we-thought/) explaining why a magnitude 4 earthquake is 1000 times as powerful as a magnitude 2 earthquake, and why the earthquake in Nepal was so devastating.

To see just how powerful the Nepal quake was (and to learn a thing or two about non-linear scales), head on over to Quartz and read [Was the Nepal earthquake twice as big as we thought?](http://qz.com/394053/was-the-nepal-earthquake-twice-as-big-as-we-thought/).

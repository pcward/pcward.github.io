When I reflect on Instructure’s commitment to openness, I can’t help thinking about Josh's keynote at this year's InstructureCon. He pointed out how, as a company, Instructure embraces openness in everything we do, from our business practices to our security audits. We support open education through our open platform, our open courses, and our OER repository.

As our Data & Analytics Product Manager, I try to keep that commitment in mind every day when I come to work. I want to help improve how Canvas collects and shares data in the most open way possible. You might be wondering, how are we embodying openness in our day-to-day work with data and analytics?

In my eyes, two themes emerge:

1. Canvas Data: today, we provide institutions with a comprehensive snapshot of their LMS data for free. It’s your data and you should have open access to it.
2. Learning analytics standards: standards enable openness which breaks down the walls between your LMS data, your SIS data, your HRIS data, and whatever other data stores you have on campus.
As we continue experimental work on our Live Events realtime analytics solution, we're proud to do so within the IMS Caliper framework. We believe the Caliper standard is the future of learning analytics. Caliper is an open standard, driven by community involvement - not a proprietary solution beholden to corporate interests. We espouse this openness because it aligns with the very essence of who we are as a company.

We're excited to rejoin the Caliper community, and can't wait to see the amazing things we can create together when the data has been freed from its silos!

<p>After setting up our in-house analytics in Tableau 7, let me tell you how intuitive Tableau 8 has made the back-end work. </p>
<p>Our main dashboards used to rely on this ugly mess of a master MySQL table to drive everything; When I say mess, I mean it. The table consisted of several blocks of information, each of which should have been its own SQL table. But Tableau 7&#8217;s data blending left a lot to be desired, so here we were. </p>
<p><span>The result was slow rendering and not very flexible reporting. We were pretty limited to providing WYSIWYG reporting to our end-users, not letting them harness the power of Tableau at all.</span></p>
<p>Tableau 8 changed all that, making linking various data sources on the fly in Desktop a breeze. Now we are able to have a properly normalized SQL structure, each piece of information in its logical place. Additionally, we can now give end-users the power to choose how and what they want to look at.</p>
<p>So far, the only drawback I can see in Tableau 8, is we still cannot use Measure Names as a global filter. Bummer. </p>
<p>But if you&#8217;re on 7, and on the fence, do yourself a favor and migrate. Our server migration took 20 minutes, and nothing broke on the back end. </p>
<p><em>Thank you, Tableau!</em></p>
